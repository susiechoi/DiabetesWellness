# DiabetesWellness
Created with Eleanor Wood and Daniel Bass-Blue as part of NIH-funded mobile health tech research at the Duke Nursing School. 

An iOS app that shows Type II diabetics their health data/trends (from mobile health devices), allows for further health information (i.e. activity, medication adherence, food), & offers features to encourage mindful eating. Developed with the intention of offering accessible guidance for Type II diabetics to better self-manage their health, as well as to collect information (not captured by the patients' mobile health devices) to give clinicians holistic insight into their patients' health behaviors.
